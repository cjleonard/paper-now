In the Permanent Atrial Fibrillation Outcome Study Using Dronedarone on Top of Standard Therapy (PALLAS) study, dronedarone use was associated with an excess risk of stroke, cardiovascular death and hospitalizations. However, an increased level in the serum digoxin level was observed in the dronedarone arm, as it is a potent inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein transport system. The PALLAS subanalysis suggests that digoxin-dronedarone interaction was responsible for the higher arrhythmic death rate observed in the trial. These data are consistent with several other studies that demonstrate the potential hazard of the use of digoxin in heart failure and/or atrial fibrillation. One must consider other safer alternatives before prescribing digoxin in atrial fibrillation patients.
